Welcome to my world where at the end of the day the peasant is as valuable as the king.  In the circle of life we all play our role and I think we all deserve a day in the king's shoes. Life is a long process and we will all play many roles.  Just remember we are all created equal in God's eyes.  The peasant deserves as much praise as the king in the grand scheme of things. Your title and your assetts mean very little compared to your compassion and good heartedness to your fellow man.  Raise up the most low so that we all may prosper.
